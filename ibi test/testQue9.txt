array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s

array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s

arr1 we are spliting 

arr2 we are reversing the array 

and arr3 again we are spliting and then pushing to array 2.

arr1 and arr2 are referencing the same array in memory, so any changes made to one will affect the other.
