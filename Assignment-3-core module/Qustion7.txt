No, Java is not considered a 100% Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. 
While Java is primarily designed to support OOP concepts, it does have certain elements 
that deviate from pure OOP principles. Here are a few reasons why Java is not considered 100% pure OOP:

Primitive Data Types: Java includes primitive data types such as int, 
float, boolean, etc., which are not objects. These primitive types 
do not have associated methods or inheritance hierarchy like objects do. However, 
Java provides wrapper classes (e.g., Integer, Float, Boolean) to represent these primitives as objects.
