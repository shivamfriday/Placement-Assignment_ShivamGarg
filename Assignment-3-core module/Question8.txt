Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Java that allows you to represent complex systems 
by simplifying and focusing on essential details while hiding unnecessary complexity. Here are some advantages 
of abstraction in Java:

Simplifies Complexity: Abstraction allows you to focus on the essential aspects 
of an object or system while hiding unnecessary implementation details. It simplifies complex systems by
 breaking them down into manageable and understandable units. This makes it easier to design, develop, and maintain 
 Java applications.

Enhances Modularity: Abstraction promotes modularity by encapsulating related functionality 
into separate units called classes or interfaces. It allows you to define clear boundaries and responsibilities
 for each component, making the code more organized, maintainable, and reusable. Modularity helps in managing the
  complexity of large applications and promotes code reusability.
